# coordinate_generator
This simple Java program produces a random set of 3D coordinates and their edges.

When the 'main' method is run, a list of randomized coordinates for a three dimensional plane will print 
along with a list of the edges that connect each coordinate.  A later effort will be to sort the coordinates so they draw a network of paths (like a street).

Paste the results in the tool below.
